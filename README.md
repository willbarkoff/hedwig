# :owl: Hedwig

Hedwig is a simple notification service. All it does is let you use a CLI to send notifications to your phone.

I created it so that Handbrake could notify me when it finished ripping a DVD.

This repository contains 3 parts.
- [./hedwig](./hedwig) - The Hedwig CLI
- [./hedwig-app](./hedwig-app) - The Headwig React native client
- [./docs](./docs) - The Hedwig documentation site

P.S. Hedwig is named after the [owl](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hedwig).
