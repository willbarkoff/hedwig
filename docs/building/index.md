Hedwig is split into 3 parts

- **App**, the Hedwig iOS and Android app, inside the `hedwig-app` directory. It's written in TypeScript with React Native.
- **CLI**, the Hedwig CLI, inside the `hedwig` directory. It's written in Go.
- **Docs**, the Hedwig Documentation site (the one you're reading right now), inside the `docs` directory. It's written using the Jekyll templating engine.

Build instructions are available for each.
